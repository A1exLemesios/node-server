These are 5 simple steps that even a monkey can follow.

1) **Install the required programs to work with this project**:

 - Install [Node.js][2]

 - Windows users need to install [Git for Windows][3].


2) **Open up a Terminal on your computer:**

 - Both Mac & Windows have some kind of a terminal already installed:

 - For **Mac OSX:** Launch the *Terminal* from your *Applications*.

 - For **Windows:** Launch *CMD* (It's somewhere on your computer).

*Note: Skip the '$' character when copy-pasting or typing the commands in your terminal*


3) **Clone the project and get into the cloned project's folder:**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nicholaswmin/node-server.git

```

5) **Run the app:**

```

**Hooray!** You're running a local server on port 8081.
